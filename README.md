# NYT Section Trends Visualization

## Project Overview

This project contains an interactive D3.js visualization of yearly article counts for different sections of The New York Times from 1999 to 2019. Users can select a section from a dropdown menu to explore how coverage for that section changed over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used is a derived version of the original New York Times Archive API data. Specifically, the data consists of yearly aggregated article counts per section, preprocessed from monthly metadata retrieved directly from the official NYT API (https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/archive-product/1/overview).
